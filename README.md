## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **AWS CodePipeline**: Automates the CI/CD workflow.
* **AWS CodeBuild**: Builds and packages the website content.
* **Amazon S3**: Hosts the static website.
* **GitHub**: Source code repository.
* **AWS IAM**: Manages permissions and access control.

---

## üöÄ Project Workflow

1. **Source Stage**: Detects changes in the GitHub repository.
2. **Build Stage**: Uses CodeBuild to package the website files.
3. **Deploy Stage**: Deploys the packaged files to an S3 bucket configured for static website hosting.

## üß™ Setup Instructions

### 1. Create a GitHub Repository

* Initialize a new repository and add your static website files (e.g., `index.html`, `styles.css`, `script.js`).

### 2. Configure Amazon S3 Bucket

* Create a new S3 bucket.
* Enable static website hosting in the bucket properties.
* Set the index document (e.g., `index.html`).

### 3. Set Up AWS CodePipeline

* Navigate to the AWS CodePipeline console.
* Create a new pipeline:

  * **Source Provider**: GitHub
  * **Build Provider**: AWS CodeBuild (optional, depending on your setup)
  * **Deploy Provider**: Amazon S3
* Define the stages and actions as per the project workflow.

## ‚úÖ Key Features

* **Automated Deployments**: Code changes trigger automatic deployments to S3.
* **Version Control Integration**: Seamless integration with GitHub for source control.
* **Scalability**: Leverages AWS's scalable infrastructure for hosting.
